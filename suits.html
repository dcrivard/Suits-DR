                    <b>Why Suits is the best: </b><br>
                    Look, let’s be clear. Suits isn’t just a show; it’s a masterclass in confidence, wit, and style. You want to be like me? Start by taking a page from Derek Rivard's book. Suits isn’t about suits; it’s about winning. Every. Single. Time. And I don’t mean just in the courtroom. Whether it’s closing deals, securing promotions, or looking damn good doing it, this show teaches you how to command respect. No one gets to the top by playing it safe. Remember this: you don’t have to be perfect; you just have to be the best at what you do. And I do it better than anyone else. We here sell the best, Harvard educated lawyers in the world. Any company that needs consultation comes right to us and we send them the best lawyer for that specific job at a billable rate. With our trusted lawyers with a golden record you can feel safe with suits backing your every move.
